### Stage 1 Goals

- Create the static HTML skeleton.
- Structure includes:
  - A `<header>` with logo and theme toggle.
  - A `<nav>` placeholder for filters (currently empty).
  - A `<section id="timeline">` to hold all timeline event entries.
  - An empty `<div id="modal">` to be used for pop-up details.
