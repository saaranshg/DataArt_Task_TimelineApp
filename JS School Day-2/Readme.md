# Timeline of Technology â€” Stage 2

## Description

This project is a timeline-based web application that visually represents major computer technological milestones.

### Stage 2 Goals

- Style the HTML skeleton created in Stage 1 into a responsive and polished layout.

- Implemented a `styles.css` (or SCSS) file including:
  - Responsive layout for the timeline using **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid**.
  - Header styling with improved typography and color scheme.
  - Placeholder styles for event markers (such as dots and labels) to visually distinguish timeline points.
  - Base styles for the modal component, which remains hidden by default until triggered.

- Ensure the design adapts smoothly across different device widths:
  - Mobile: viewport width less than 768px
  - Tablet: viewport width between 768px and 1023px
  - Desktop: viewport width 1024px and above

> No JavaScript functionality added yet; this update focuses purely on responsive styling and layout polish.
